This project is a web-based music production and sequencer.  

It features a browser-based JavaScript REPL (Read Evaluate Parse Loop) for creating sounds and music with a visual sequencer to layer these elements across horizontal time.

REPL features:
=====
* ability to pick chords and notes from standard octave range
* transpose chords and notes
* supports alternate oscillator sounds such as sawtooth and square
* mapping rhythm and notes/chords onto each other and vice versa

SEQUENCER features:
====
* drag and drop code blocks as sample
* interactive repl to test sounds
* save functions as riffs for future use
